UnrealCV is a project to use photo-realistic game for computer vision research. In this project, we extend games to provide annotation for the virtual scene. We also provide python/MATLAB code to interact with the virtual scene.

UnrealCV is a project to bridge game industry with computer vision research community. Games are designed for players. We compile UnrealCV server code inside a game to make it able to communicate with our clients.

Unreal Engine is one of the best game engines, it provides excellent rendering power. Naive Physics. Unreal Engine is open source and creates enormous possibility. Games designed using Unreal Engine can be extended by UnrealCV. We will provide a few compiled examples and show how to extend a game yourself.

<!-- Do so say the importance of this project, leave it to the tech report -->
<!-- What problem UnrealCV is solving? -->
Video Games are originally designed to be interactive by human players. We hope computer vision algorithms can be trained and tested in the a virtual world. By creating UnrealCV, we extend a video game. The game can not only controlled by keyboard and mouse, but also controlled by a set of commands. The commands can be used to control the camera, get information from the scene. This makes the an algorithm can easily interact with the video game.
