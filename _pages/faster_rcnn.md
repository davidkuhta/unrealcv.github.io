Make sure you read [Getting Started](getting_started.html) and know how to use the compiled binary.

The code for this tutorial can be found in `/client/examples/faster-rcnn.py`.

Testing. Training can be done by generating images.

Everytime when you click the mouse in the scene, an image will be sent to Faster RCNN for detection.
