# Getting Started

Here we will use RealisticRendering as an example. RealisticRendering is a demo created by Epic Games to showcase the rendering ability of UnrealEngine.

First, download the binaries of this game. [Windows](), [Linux](). (Tested in Ubuntu 14.04)

Unzip it and Run `[Platform]NoEditor/RealisticRendering/Binaries/[Platform]/RealisticRendering`. If the program crash for any reason, you can reported [an issue]().

# Interact with the program



## Connect with the program  

`python demo_client.py` to run a demo script. This demo will show message sent from the virtual scene and can also send commands. How to use python script to generate an image dataset, see [generate dataset](ipynb_generate_images.html) for a step-by-step instruction.

The python client is documented [here](client.html#python).

Understand the command system.

Next: Check the Tutorials:

- [Generate a set of images from the binary](ipynb_generate_images.html)

- [Integrate with faster RCNN](faster_rcnn.html)
