---

Welcome to the CVPR17 demo page of UnrealCV. This page contains what you saw in our demo station. Our demo time is 07/22 Morning 10:30 - 12:30 and Afternoon 15:00 - 17:00. Please share this link with your friends if you like our demo.

The videos and live demos are within these categories

- Generic:
- Detection, segmentation:
- Reinforcement learning:

## Video

The first video includes the various 3D scenes.

- A virtual supermarket created using UE4
- Matinee



- Faster RCNN
- Bounding Box Generation
- Stereo depth estimation in a virtual scene
- Indoor navigation and object interaction

## Live demo

- Faster-RCNN detection demo

Move a virtual camera in a virtual room, see how well the detection algorithm works. Also demonstrate the ground truth that can be produced by a virtual scene using UnrealCV.

You can reproduce this demo with

- Virtual supermarket project
- A virtual robo arm
