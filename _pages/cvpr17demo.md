title: UnrealCV - CVPR 17 Demo
---

Welcome to the CVPR17 demo page of UnrealCV. This page contains what you saw in our demo station. Our demo time is 07/22 Morning 10:30 - 12:30 and Afternoon 15:00 - 17:00. Please share this link with your friends if you like our demo.

## Video

The first video includes the various 3D scenes.

Virtual worlds

- A static virtual scene, RealisticRendering
- A dynamic virtual scene, Matinee
- A virtual supermarket in which grocery items are randomly placed for training

The second video demonstrate various applications of UnrealCV

- Object mask generation in a virtual supermarket
- Stereo depth estimation in a virtual scene
- Indoor navigation and object interaction
- Bounding Box Generation and running a detection algorithm in a virtual scene.

## Live demo

- Faster-RCNN detection demo

Move a virtual camera in a virtual room, see how well the detection algorithm works. Also demonstrate the ground truth that can be produced by a virtual scene using UnrealCV.

You can reproduce this demo with two simple steps

1. Download the RealisticRendering virtual scene from our model zoo http://unrealcv.org/model_zoo
2. Follow the tutorial in this page http://docs.unrealcv.org/en/master/tutorials/faster_rcnn.html

- Virtual supermarket project
- A virtual robotics arm
